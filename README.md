# Covid Pass Letter Service Front End

The NHS COVID Pass Letter Service lets you request an NHS COVID-19 Pass online for yourself or a child (if you are their parent or legal guardian) without having to create an NHS login account. This COVID-19 Pass will then be sent by email.

You can also request an NHS COVID Pass letter for travel to be sent by post, including for children aged 5 or over, if you meet a list of acceptance criteria which can be found here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/nhs-covid-pass/get-an-nhs-covid-pass/

The NHS COVID-19 Pass or letter for travel received allow you to show others the details of your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad to some countries or territories.

The NHS COVID Pass Letter Service Front End â€“ is a web application run on the [ASP.NET MVC framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc).
